<p>Hi there everyone!  My name is Jon Arbuckle. I am 30 years old and I am a cat lover. Although my pets drive me <i>crazy</i>, I can't imagine life without them.</p>
<p>I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough for food to feed them. It includes marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <b>lots and lots</b> of lasagna.  
Wnen I come home, i'm there for 10 seconds, and then have to go back to the store to buy more food.  <i>I wasn't too happy.</i> </p>
